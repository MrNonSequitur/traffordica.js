	<p>Traffordica.js is a software toy that allows for logical and efficient playing of musical notes and chords with a computer keyboard. As the name suggests, it is a Javascript implementation of the Traffordica. You will need Javascript enabled to use this page.</p>
	<p>Your browser's keyboard shortcuts should be disabled on this page. If aren't, then maybe try focusing on this text box:</p>
	<input></input>
	<p>You can type notes from octaves 3 to 6 (7 if you have function keys). Control will toggle chord mode, which allows you to type chords. Home row is major chords, bottom row is minor chords.</p>
	<!--<p>It is relatively trivial for Traffordica.js to support a new keyboard, but due to the large number of keyboards it is more or less impossible to support <i>all</i> keyboards.</p>-->
